@book{Siciliano2009,
abstract = {The classic text on robot manipulators now covers visual control, motion planning and mobile robots too!Robotics provides the basic know-how on the foundations of robotics: modelling, planning and control. The text develops around a core of consistent and rigorous formalism with fundamental and technological material giving rise naturally and with gradually increasing difficulty to more advanced considerations.The theory of manipulator structures presented in the early part of the book encompasses:{\^{a}} the fundamentals: kinematics, statics and trajectory planning; and{\^{a}} the technology of actuators, sensors and control units.Subsequently, more advanced instruction is given in:{\^{a}} dynamics and motion control of robot manipulators;{\^{a}} mobile robots;{\^{a}} motion planning; and{\^{a}} interaction with the environment using exteroceptive sensory data (force and vision).Appendices ensure that students will have access to a consistent level of background in basic areas such as rigid-body mechanics, feedback control, and others. Problems are raised and the proper tools established to find engineering-oriented solutions rather than to focus on abstruse theoretical methodology. To impart practical skill, more than 60 examples and case studies are carefully worked out and interwoven through the text, with frequent resort to simulation. In addition, nearly 150 end-of-chapter problems are proposed, and the book is accompanied by a solutions manual (downloadable from www.springer.com/978-1-84628-641-4) containing the MATLAB{\^{A}} code for computer problems; this is available free of charge to those adopting Robotics as a textbook for courses. This text is suitable for use in senior undergraduate and graduate courses in automation and computer, electrical, electronic and mechanical engineering courses with strong robotics content.},

title="State of the Art and Conceptual Design of Robotic Solutions for In Situ Hard Coating of Hydraulic Turbines",

pages="105--113",
abstract="Hydropower turbine's blades are constantly exposed to abrasion and cavitation phenomena, demanding regular maintenance for flow stability. Hard coating techniques by thermal aspersion are used to reduce the mechanical wear, thus increasing blade's life cycle, and turbine efficiency. Currently, applying a new coating layer requires turbine disassembling and recalibration. EMMA is a robotic system to perform hard coating by thermal spray on hydraulic turbine blades within the turbine environment, i.e., hard coating application to an installed blade, significantly reducing the turbine downtime. This document is a study of the state of the art of in situ hydropower turbine robotic systems and describes the conceptual designs for EMMA. The results outlines the next steps for EMMA and future projects in the same area.",
